      I read an article from Elite Daily this morning titled: <br />
      <a
        href="https://www.elitedaily.com/life/culture/optimistic-people-have-one-thing-common-always-late/1097735"
      >
        ‚Äúoptimistic-people-have-one-thing-in-common-always-late‚Äù</a
      >
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
      Nothing's better than the headline,
      <em
        >‚ÄúThe reason people are [bad quality] is actually because they're [good
        quality].‚Äù</em
      >
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
      As I continued reading, it turns out that the<strong>
        Late people are actually the best people ever</strong
      >. They are optimistic and hopeful:
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
      <em
        >‚ÄúPeople who are continuously late are actually just more optimistic.
        They believe they can fit more tasks into a limited amount of time more
        than other people and thrive when they're multitasking. Simply put,
        they're fundamentally hopeful.‚Äù</em
      >
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>They're Big-thinking:</strong></p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
      <em
        >‚ÄúPeople who are habitually late don't sweat over the small stuff, they
        concentrate on the big picture and see the future as full of infinite
        possibilities.‚Äù</em
      >
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Late people just get it:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
      <em
        >‚ÄúPeople with a tendency for tardiness like to stop and smell the
        roses‚Ä¶life was never meant to be planned down to the last detail.
        Remaining excessively attached to timetables signifies an inability to
        enjoy the moment.‚Äù</em
      >
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
      By the end of the article, I had never felt prouder to be a late person.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
      But also, what the heck is going on? I'm not late because I like to smell
      the roses, or because I see the bigger picture,<br> or because the future is
      full of infinite possibilities, or time is not real it is relative, or
      blah blah blah and also I am not always late.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">I'm late to college because I don't take it seriously.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
      So I thought and thought and thought and figured out, that there are two
      types of lateness:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Okay Lateness:</strong> This is when the late person being late
        does not negatively impact anyone else‚Äîlike being late to a party or a
        group hangout.Things can start on time and proceed as normal with or
        without the late person being there.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <strong>Not Okay Lateness: </strong> This is when the late person being
        late <em>does</em> negatively impact others‚Äîlike being late to a
        two-person dinner or meeting or anything else that simply can‚Äôt start
        until the late person arrives. Here the lateness has consequences.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">And there are two types of people who are chronically not okay late:</p>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        <strong> Those who don't feel bad or wrong about it.</strong><br /><br>
        These people are idiots. They think they're a little more special than
        everyone else, like the zero-remorse narcissist at the top of the
        article. They're unappealing.
      </li>
      <br />

        />
      <br /><br>
      </center>
      <li>
        <strong>Those who feel terrible and self-loathing about it.</strong
        ><br /><br>
        These people have problems. Let call them CLIPs (Chronically Late Insane
        Person).While both groups of not okay late people end up regularly
        frustrating others,<br> a reliable way to identify a Group 2 CLIP is a
        bizarre compulsion to defeat themselves‚Äîsome deep inner drive to
        inexplicably miss the first lecture,<br> feel stressed about rushing to college,
        crush their own reputation by standing in hallway until the class end, etc. <br>
        As much as they may hurt others, they usually hurt themselves even more.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Maybe I am a CLIP.<br>
      It's often the same story, something like this: 
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Let's say I have to reach the college at 10:00 AM.
       When I lay out my schedule for the day, I'll have the perfect plan. <br>
       I'll leave early, arrive early, and get there around 9:50 AM (That's the best I can do).
       That takes all the stress out of the situation,<br> It'll be great, I'll wake up early,
       I'll leave the home by 9:05 and reach by college by 9:50 and I'll still have the minutes to spare.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">All I have to do is to leave the home by 9:05 AM. To do that, I have to be up by 8:00,<br>
       so let's be safe and wakeup at 7:45 and leave the home by 9:05 or earlier, and I'm set.
       What a plan.<br> Here's how it will play out:

    <p>CLIPs are strange people.I'm sure each CLIP is insane in their own special way,
      and to understand how they work,<br> you'll usually have to get to some dark inner psychology.
      I'm late because of the following traits maybe:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>I underestimate how long things takes.</strong> For me every thing seems like a 5 minute task.
          But in reality it takes much longer than that.<br> All I remember is that one time when things
          went the <em>quickest.</em> And that time stays in my head rent-free as how long that task
          takes.
        </li><br>
        <li>
        <strong>I have a weird aversion to changing circumstances.</strong>
          Like Newton said in his First Law of Motion <br> <em> Every object will remain at rest or
          in uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change its state by the action of an external force.</em><br>
          For the CLIPs that external force is Panic Monster or Panic Attack.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      So yeah, that's why I'm late‚Äîbecause I'm insane. Don't excuse the CLIPs in your life‚Äîit's
      not okay and they need to fix it‚Äîbut remember, it's not about you. They have problems.
